    <p>
        Tune Browser is a web application which should work in any modern web browser, including mobile browsers
        on smartphones or tablets.
    </p>

    <p>
        On mobile devices, you can create a shortcut on your home screen which makes Tune Browser work in full screen
        mode, almost like a native app, without requiring installation from Play Store or App Store.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have a Google account, you can create and edit your own tune books and store them on Google Drive. Before
        you can do so, you will have to log in to your Google account from Tune Browser. The login dialogue uses a
        separate browser window which directly communicates with Google.

        Tune Browser will create a folder <code>Tune Browser</code> containing your tune books.
    </p>

    <p>Tune Browser does not collect any personal data from its users.</p>

    <p>
        Tune Browser is hosted on GitHub Pages and (optionally) uses Google Drive for storing your tune books. If you
        are worried about privacy, please review the terms of service of these providers. Tune Browser has no influence
        on user tracking performed by these services.
