## Getting started

Tune Browser is a web application which should work in any modern web browser, including mobile browsers
on smartphones or tablets.

### Desktop

Open [folkies.github.io](https://folkies.github.io/) in your favourite browser.

### Mobile

On mobile devices, you can create a shortcut on your home screen which makes Tune Browser work in full screen
mode, almost like a native app, without requiring installation from Play Store or App Store.

* Open [folkies.github.io](https://folkies.github.io/) in Chrome or Firefox.
* Select **Add to start screen** from the browser menu. This will install an icon on your start screen.
* Now simply tap the icon to launch Tune Browser. Behind the scenes, this will launch a browser in full screen mode. The status and navigation bars are hidden by default. Just swipe upwards from the bottom of the screen to show the navigation bar.

### Using Google Drive (optional)

If you have a Google account, you can create and edit your own tune books and store them on Google Drive. Before
you can do so, you will have to log in to your Google account from Tune Browser. The login dialogue uses a
separate browser window which directly communicates with Google.

Tune Browser will create a folder `Tune Browser` containing your tune books.

## Privacy

Tune Browser does not collect any personal data from its users.

Tune Browser is hosted on GitHub Pages and (optionally) uses Google Drive for storing your tune books. If you
are worried about privacy, please review the terms of service of these providers. Tune Browser has no influence
on user tracking performed by these services.
